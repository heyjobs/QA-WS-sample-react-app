# Sample react app

Simple application with React js. used bor the QA working student test

## Instructions for solving the problem

The process to start is simple, 
1. Make sure you have [git installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your computer
2. Make sure you have [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your computer. 
3. Then [load this repository on your computer](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository) and run the application by using the following sets of commands

```bash
    git clone [This Repository]

    cd [Repository-Directory]

    npm install

    npm start
```

or if you prefer to use yarn:

```bash
    git clone [This Repository]

    cd [Repository-Directory]

    yarn install

    yarn start
```

4. The start command should run the local server and automatically open the `http://localhost:3000/` where you can checkout the app which only has 3 main features/pages.

5. You are expected to write at least 6 test cases for these features. here is a [guide to writing effective test cases](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/how-to-write-effective-test-cases-test-cases-procedures-and-definitions/)
6. Please write the tests in the format that you see fit and upload a pdf of your answer file on HackerRank
